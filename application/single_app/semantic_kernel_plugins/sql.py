build sql plugin, cosmos plugin, postgres sql plugin



build database agent, one thing thats in the agent  is to ask clarifying question to build the right query and to provide the user with details to help ensure it is the correct query...expand on this logic....it will be up to the admin or user to create actions to assign to the agent...this would be a good example use case along with an openapi one...



we need two plugins, Get Schema and Query
