"""
Test to verify that workspace file uploads don't create conversations.

This test ensures that when files are uploaded to personal workspaces, group workspaces,
or public workspaces, no conversations are created and no "file content not found" errors
occur due to the shared_group_ids field missing from the search index.

Bug Fixed: 
1. File uploads from workspace were creating conversations when they shouldn't
2. Search index updates were failing due to shared_group_ids field not existing in API version 2024-07-01
