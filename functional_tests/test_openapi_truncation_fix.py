📝 Manual Test Instructions:

**Issue Fixed:**
- **Previous:** API responses were truncated at 50,000 characters, showing only 5 items
- **Current:** API responses now truncated at 100,000 characters, showing 10 items
- **Agent Understanding:** Better messaging helps agent understand what data is available

**Changes Made:**

1. **Increased Response Limit:**
   - Old: 50,000 characters (too restrictive for news APIs)
   - New: 100,000 characters (better coverage for news data)

2. **Better Truncation Strategy:**
   - Old: Show only first 5 items
   - New: Show first 10 items with better metadata

3. **Improved Agent Communication:**
   - Clear indication that data is available but truncated
   - Specific suggestions for filtering (date, category, country)
   - Better context about what data exists

**Expected Behavior:**
✅ **News API calls** should now return more articles (10 vs 5)
✅ **Agent responses** should be more helpful about available data
✅ **Truncation messages** should guide users on how to filter results
✅ **No "too large" errors** - agent knows data exists and how to work with it

**Testing Steps:**
1. Ask agent: "show me the top 3 results for us news"
2. Agent should now be able to work with the first 10 news items
3. Agent should provide specific news articles, not just "too large" message
4. If still truncated, agent should suggest specific filtering options

**Debug Log to Watch For:**
- `Response too large (XXX chars), truncating to 100000 chars`
- Should see "showing first 10 items" instead of "showing first 5 items"
- Better agent responses with actual news content

**File Modified:** semantic_kernel_plugins/openapi_plugin.py
**Version:** 0.226.088
