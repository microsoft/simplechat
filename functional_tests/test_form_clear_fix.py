   - Choose any type (e.g., SQL Schema)
   - Complete and save the plugin

2. **Create Second Plugin:**
   - Click "New Action" again
   - ‚úÖ **Verify fields are EMPTY:**
     - Name field should be blank
     - Description field should be blank  
     - No action type should be selected
     - All form fields should be cleared

   - Should be able to create new plugin without interference
