## Technical Details

### Structure Pattern
Each logging option now follows this structure:
```html
<div class="card p-3 mb-3">
    <h5>Section Title</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">Clear description of what this setting controls.</p>
    <div class="form-check form-switch mb-3">
        <!-- Toggle switch and label -->
    </div>
    <!-- Optional alerts for warnings/info -->
</div>
```

### CSS Classes Used
- `card p-3 mb-3` - Card container with padding and bottom margin
- `text-muted` - Subtle text color for descriptions
- `form-check form-switch mb-3` - Toggle switch styling
