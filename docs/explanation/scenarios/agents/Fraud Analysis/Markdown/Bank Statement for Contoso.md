### Bank Statement for Contoso

**Overview:** This will mimic a standard bank statement for the primary operating account of the company.
**Fraudulent Element:** The statement will show large deposits from "Project X" clients (who don't exist), which correlate with the inflated sales on the Income Statement. However, there will be a notable absence of subsequent cash collections, indicating that while sales were recorded, the money was never actually received.

**Key Elements:**

- **Account Information:** Account number, bank details.
- **Account Name:** Contoso Operating Account
- **Statement Period:** e.g., December 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023.

### **Ending Balance (Dec 31, 2023)**  
**$9,355,000.00**

**Key Fraud Context (Fictional):**  
- No deposits from **Aurora Systems LLC** or **Zenith Solutions Group** appear in December, despite invoices for $750,000 and $1,250,000 respectively being dated earlier in the fourth quarter.  
- Cash inflows are modest compared to the large revenues reported in the fictional income statement, tying back to inflated AR balances in the fictional balance sheet and AR ledger.  
- This disconnect between bank records and reported sales is a common red flag in forensic accounting and fraud detection.
