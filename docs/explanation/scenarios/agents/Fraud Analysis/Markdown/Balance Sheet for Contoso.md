### Balance Sheet for Contoso

**Overview:** This will be a snapshot as of December 31, 2023. It will balance assets, liabilities, and equity.
**Fraudulent Element:** The "Accounts Receivable" asset will be inflated to match the fictitious sales recorded in the Income Statement, representing the payments "owed" by non-existent or fabricated clients. This will be a significant red flag when cross-referenced with the Accounts Receivable Ledger.

**Key Sections:**

- **Assets:**
  - **Current Assets:** Cash, Accounts Receivable (inflated), Prepaid Expenses.
  - **Non-Current Assets:** Property, Plant & Equipment (Net), Intangible Assets (e.g., patented algorithms), Long-term Investments.
- **Liabilities:**
  - **Current Liabilities:** Accounts Payable, Short-term Loans, Accrued Expenses.
  - **Non-Current Liabilities:** Long-term Debt, Deferred Revenue.
- **Equity:** Share Capital, Retained Earnings (inflated by the fake net income), Other Comprehensive Income.

**Narrative Context:** The Balance Sheet will reflect a seemingly strong financial position, with a healthy increase in assets, primarily driven by the growth in Accounts Receivable, which aligns with the robust sales figures presented in the Income Statement.

### **Narrative Context (Fiction)**  
This fictional balance sheet presents what appears to be a robust financial position for Contoso. Assets have grown sharply compared to the prior year, attributed to "exceptional" sales performance.  
A large increase in **Accounts Receivable** aligns directly with the inflated sales figures in the equally fictional income statement — in this scenario, many receivables represent amounts owed by non-existent or fabricated clients (*Project X fake invoices*). The growth in retained earnings also reflects the inflated net income from those fictitious revenues.  
This is a fictional red flag scenario for educational purposes only.

### **Red Flags Highlighted (Educational)**  
1. **Accounts Receivable disproportionate growth** – Rising far faster than historical trends or industry norms; not matched by cash collections.  
2. **Retained Earnings boost without corresponding cash flow** – Suggests paper profits rather than real inflows.  
3. **Mismatch between Deferred Revenue and reported sales** – Low deferred revenue compared to large sales hints that not all sales are backed by contractual commitments.
