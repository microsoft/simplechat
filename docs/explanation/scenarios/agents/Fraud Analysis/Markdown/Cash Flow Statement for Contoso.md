### Cash Flow Statement Narrative Context (Fiction)**  
In this fictional scenario, Contoso claims a record-setting year in terms of profit. However, when examining actual cash flows, the weakness in collections is obvious. A swelling Accounts Receivable balance — driven by fabricated sales such as the $30M "Project X" contract — absorbs much of the cash that would otherwise be generated by operations. This imbalance between net income and operating cash highlights a key **red flag for revenue recognition fraud**, and serves as an example for audit training and fraud detection exercises.n this fictional scenario, Contoso claims a record-setting year in terms of profit.

**Overview:** This statement will detail cash inflows and outflows for the year ending December 31, 2023, using the indirect method.
**Fraudulent Element:** The cash flow from operating activities will *not* show a corresponding increase in cash from customers, despite the high sales reported in the Income Statement and the inflated Accounts Receivable on the Balance Sheet. This discrepancy (high sales, high receivables, but low actual cash collected) is a classic indicator of revenue recognition fraud. The net income will be adjusted for non-cash items, but the large increase in Accounts Receivable will act as a significant deduction, tempering the reported cash flow from operations.

**Key Sections:**

- 
- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** Net Income (from Income Statement), adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation, amortization), and changes in working capital (e.g., *increase in Accounts Receivable*).
- **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** Purchases/Sales of PP&E, Investments.
- **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** Debt issuance/repayment, Equity transactions, Dividends paid.
- **Net Increase/Decrease in Cash:** Sum of the above.
- **Beginning & Ending Cash Balance:** Reconciliation.

**Narrative Context:** Despite impressive net income, the cash flow statement will subtly reveal that actual cash generation from operations is not as robust, hinting at collection issues or uncollected revenue.





## **Cash Flow Statement**  
**Contoso**  

**For the Year Ended December 31, 2023**  

### **Narrative Context (Fiction)**  
In this fictional scenario, Contoso claims a record-setting year in terms of profit. However, when examining actual cash flows, the weakness in collections is obvious. A swelling Accounts Receivable balance — driven by fabricated sales such as the $30M “Project X” contract — absorbs much of the cash that would otherwise be generated by operations. This imbalance between net income and operating cash highlights a key **red flag for revenue recognition fraud**, and serves as an example for audit training and fraud detection exercises.

- Amortization of Intangibles: $1,000,000  
- Unrealized investment gains: ($500,000)  

**Changes in Working Capital:**  
- **Increase in Accounts Receivable (inflated)**: **($30,000,000)** ← Major deduction; reflects fake sales not collected in cash.

- Increase in Accounts Payable: $1,000,000  
- Decrease in Accrued Expenses: ($200,000)

**Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:**  
= 51,750,000 + 2,500,000 + 1,000,000 − 500,000 − 30,000,000 − 250,000 + 1,000,000 − 200,000 + 500,000

### **Key Red Flags (Educational)**
1. **Operating cash flow far below net income** – Suggests profits are not being matched with actual collections.  
2. **Major increase in Accounts Receivable** – Implies revenue may be from clients who do not exist or cannot/will not pay.  
3. **Healthy financing inflow masks weak operations** – Borrowed funds inflate cash position despite core business cash weakness.
