### Expense Reports

**Overview:** Itemized lists of costs incurred by employees.
**Fraudulent Element:** For the purpose of *this specific fraud scenario*, I will keep expense reports clean. Overly complex fraud often involves multiple layers, but for demonstrative purposes, focusing on revenue inflation through fake sales provides a clear path for agentic workflow detection. However, in a real scenario, inflated or fictitious expense reports could also be part of the fraud.

**Key Details:**

- **Employee Name:** Fictional employees (e.g., Alex Chen, Sarah Miller).
- **Department:** Sales, Consulting, R&D.
- **Date Range:** Specific period.
- **Itemized Expenses:** Travel, Meals, Supplies, Client Entertainment.
- **Vendor:** "Fictional Transport Co.," "Gourmet Bites Cafe," "Contoso Office Supplies."
- **Amount, Description, GL Account Code.**

### **Narrative Context (Fiction)**  
In this scenario, all expense reports appear routine and legitimate, with no fictitious claims or inflated spending. This helps illustrate how the fraud in our case study is centered solely on *revenue inflation via fake sales* — while other records remain clean to avoid suspicion and complexity.  
In a real‑world fraud investigation, expense reports are also reviewed to ensure no secondary schemes (such as embezzlement or padding of travel costs) are occurring.
