## Technical Achievement
This enhancement transforms a complete failure (error message) into a successful information extraction with full user transparency about the AI processing that made it possible.

The system now handles documents that exceed processing limits by:
1. **Extracting** full content via Document Intelligence
2. **Chunking** content into manageable pieces
3. **Summarizing** each chunk with AI
4. **Reporting** exact metrics throughout the process
5. **Delivering** usable information with clear transparency

## User Experience Impact
- **Before**: Frustration and no access to information
- **After**: Immediate access with clear understanding of what was processed and how
