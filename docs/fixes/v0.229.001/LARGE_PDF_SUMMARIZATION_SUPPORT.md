# Large PDF Summarization Support Enhancement

**Version Implemented:** 0.229.001

## Overview

The Smart HTTP Plugin has been enhanced to support large PDF documents through intelligent chunked summarization. This enhancement allows users to access and extract meaningful information from PDF documents that would previously be rejected due to size limitations.

## Version Information

- **Version**: 0.228.021
- **Enhancement**: Clearer, more readable summarization metrics with separated lines
- **Previous Version**: 0.228.020 (comprehensive metrics)
- **Base Version**: 0.228.015 (initial large PDF support)

## Problem Addressed

Previously, the SmartHttpPlugin would reject PDF documents larger than ~150KB (max_content_size * 2) with the error:
```
Error: Content too large (1376852 bytes). Try a different URL or specific page.
```

This prevented access to many valuable documents, such as government reports, research papers, and comprehensive manuals.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Size Limits

The plugin now uses different size limits based on content type:
- **PDF Documents**: Up to 1.5MB (max_content_size * 20)
- **Other Content**: 150KB (max_content_size * 2) - unchanged

### 2. Chunked Summarization Process

For large PDFs that exceed the normal content size after Document Intelligence processing:

1. **Full Text Extraction**: Document Intelligence processes the entire PDF
2. **Content Analysis**: Check if extracted text exceeds manageable size (225KB)
3. **Intelligent Chunking**: Split content into ~100KB chunks for processing
4. **Individual Summarization**: Each chunk is summarized using Azure OpenAI
5. **Summary Combination**: All chunk summaries are combined
6. **Executive Summary**: If needed, create a final executive summary

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

- If summarization fails, content is truncated with clear messaging
- If Azure OpenAI is unavailable, falls back to traditional truncation
- Missing dependencies are handled gracefully

## Technical Implementation

### Key Methods Added

#### `_summarize_large_content(content: str, uri: str) -> str`
- Handles chunked summarization of large content
- Uses Azure OpenAI for intelligent summarization
- Implements retry logic and fallback mechanisms

#### Enhanced `_process_pdf_content()`
- Detects when content requires summarization
- Provides clear user messaging about content reduction
- Maintains full context while staying within limits

#### Updated `_read_limited_content()`
- Allows larger download sizes for PDFs
- Maintains efficient memory usage
- Respects content-type headers

### Size Management

```python
# Dynamic limits based on content type
pdf_limit = max_content_size * 20      # ~1.5MB
regular_limit = max_content_size * 2   # ~150KB
summarization_threshold = max_content_size * 3  # ~225KB
```

## User Experience
