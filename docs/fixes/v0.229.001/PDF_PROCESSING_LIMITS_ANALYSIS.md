## PDF Processing Limits Analysis

**Version Implemented:** 0.229.001

### Current Issues:

1. **Inconsistent Limits**: We have a 2.25MB download limit but check against 500MB DI limit
2. **Arbitrary Character Limits**: 225k character limit for summarization doesn't align with actual DI capabilities  
3. **Overly Restrictive**: Many legitimate PDFs (like the 1.5MB NIST PDF) barely fit or exceed our limits

### Recommended Changes:

**Option 1: Align with Azure DI Limits (Recommended)**
- Download limit: Increase to match Azure DI (500MB for S0, 4MB for F0 tier)
- Remove arbitrary character-based processing limits
- Let Azure DI handle what it can process
- Use summarization only when extracted text exceeds token context limits

**Option 2: Keep Conservative Limits**
- Current approach but with better size calculations
- Clear messaging about why we limit downloads
- Faster processing for most use cases

**Option 3: Dynamic Limits Based on Tier**
- Detect Azure DI tier and adjust limits accordingly
- S0 tier: 500MB limit
- F0 tier: 4MB limit

### Current Limits Breakdown:
```
Download Limits:
- PDFs: 75k chars × 30 = 2.25MB 
- Other content: 75k chars × 2 = 150KB

Processing Limits:
- Summarization trigger: 75k chars × 3 = 225k chars
- Azure DI check: 500MB
- Max pages: 2,000 (Azure DI limit)
```

### Real-World Examples:
- NIST PDF: 1.5MB - barely fits current limits
- Academic papers: Often 2-10MB
- Government documents: Can be 50-100MB
- Technical manuals: Often exceed current limits

### Recommendation:
**Use Option 1** - Align with Azure DI limits for better user experience while maintaining intelligent summarization based on actual token limits rather than arbitrary character counts.
